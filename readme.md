## Most frequently asked questions

**Q: Can I make a pull request?**

**Q: Can I hire/consult you?**

**A:** Yes. Please refer to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sjoerdhooft/) 'About' section for availability. I also appreciate any contact to go through LinkedIn.

**Q: Can I follow you?**

**A:** Yes. I'm online only on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sjoerdhooft/) and [Blue Sky](https://bsky.app/profile/getshifting.com).
